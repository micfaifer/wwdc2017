In this playground, you can configure the game to play custom sounds when words match. You can choose from one of the included chords from the C major scale as a sound choice, so the strings you can insert are Am Dm Em C G E F Bd and Bdim. But you can also do your own improvisation, recording sounds in other apps like GarageBand and importing them in here, the behavior is the same.

If possible, I fully recommend you to use this playground on an iPad for a better experience. To do this, you'll need to download the .playground file on your iPad and open it with the Swift Playgrounds app.
 
 # Idea ðŸ’¡
 This game's idea is to allow players to learn a bit of programming with SKAction and play with music in the meantime.
